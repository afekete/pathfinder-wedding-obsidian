The Immortal Principality of Ustalav is where most of this campaign will be taking place. It's analagous to the real world Transylvania with various myths of vampires, werewolves, and other sorts of creatures of the night. It is a loosely gathered collection of counties and dukedoms ruled by the prince in Caliphas, his highness, Prince Aduard Ordranti III. To the west, there are the Gravelands (formerly known as Lastwall) and the Hold of Belkzen. The Gravelands are under the rule of the Whispering Tyrant , Tar-Baphon; a lich king long thought to be permanently sealed within his tower at Gallowspire during the shining crusade 300 years ago. The country of Lastwall was formed to maintain the vigil on the Whispering Tyrant and was the first land to fall. Three years ago, he freed himself from his tower and his undead hordes ran rampant across the continent in a mad dash to claim the starstone of Absalom for himself and ascend to true godhood. A combined army held him back and he has retreated to his fortress on the Isle of Terror in Lake Encarthan which lies on Ustalav's southern shores. The Hold of Belkzen is the name given to the collection of orcish clans to the northwest of Ustalav. Previously, they had served the Whispering Tyrant Tar-Baphon but due to a betrayal near the end of the shining crusade, now despise him and are actively fighting his forces and attempting to unify their clans to better resist.

Respectively, they were: shoot everything that moves in the sky or chase it down. Neither worked. One of the injured invisi-bois escaped over the castle low wall but Erimor has a sense for where it went. The guards and Landsmaster Lorelei Grisham came to figure out what had happened in the meantime among the gruesome surgery Erimor and Cerbera were conducting on the dead invisi-boi. Biggest things that came out were that the wight/zombie was a former gardenhand named Elemer Greevs and that as far as anyone could tell, he had not completed his objective, whatever it was. Landsmaster Lorelei Grisham , not being magically inclined, passed off the information to the court mage, Ariox Corundum (not condom. Stop it. Get some help). After many squawks, chirps, stutters, and coos, Ariox pieced together using his disturbing knowledgeability of necromancy and demonology that the many recent bloody events around the counties were focal points for some sort of immense Summoning Circle . Two points are missing: the one that remains incomplete in the servant's quarters, and one at an old haunted home named the Saffron House owned by a deceased baron possibly associated with the Whispering Tyrant. Ariox intends to go disrupt one of the other major focal points with Lorelei and a small company in tow while the party ventures to the Saffron House which is suspected to be the base of operations based on the fact that the summoning must be initiated from there. Before heading out, the party makes a quick stop at Elemer's roommate's place. Alison Kindler , the roommate, comes out, fixes Jean-Os ' boots and invites everyone in. The party finds practiced runes in Elemer's room and a withering mandragora (a plant watered with demon blood).
