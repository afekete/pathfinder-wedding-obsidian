You guys investigated the break-ins and found out that some of the servants were feeling like they were being watched and that they were missing chunks of time from their memory. You asked around a bit but didn't really find much else other than that the servant's quarters are not particularly well guarded. You guys found wax on a windowsill and a rune in the storeroom. Set up an ambush and the spooky wight paralyzed everyone except the automatons and [Erimor](../People/Erimor.md) while he tried to break in. A gunshot from [Ganash](../People/Ganash.md) woke everyone up and you fought some invisi-bois and the zombie with a mask on its face that actually ended up being a face-eating bat creature.
