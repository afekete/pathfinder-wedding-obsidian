We pick up in a forest with a wizard beat to a pulp by a robot, a spider the size of a horse being devoured by wormies, and a headless horseman. He was like that when you got there. The wizard turns out to be a necromancer and associated with a demon lord, [Sarkoris](../People/Sarkoris.md), that was sealed up when the worldwound to the north closed. [Cerbera](../People/Cerbera.md), [Jean-Os](../People/Jean-Os.md), and [Jamie](../People/Jamie.md) loot the bodies and head back to tell the [Alderman Wulfric Mirodin](../People/Alderman%20Wulfric%20Mirodin.md) the good news. They dilly dally for a bit and give a cat to an asshole before hopping on the wedding caravan the next day to get back to the city of [Ardis](../Locations/Ardis.md). Some of you partook of the devil's lettuce before heading out to include a passed out orc and a clunky robot named [Ganash](../People/Ganash.md). Oh, and some prepper looking guy named [Erimor](../People/Erimor.md) came back from scouting ahead. You guys stop for the night and get assaulted by an army of the living dead headed by an Urdefhan, normally a commander of small demonic forces. The rest of the trip to [Ardis](../Locations/Ardis.md) is uneventful and you all meet up with [Seneschal Marov Harkomir](../People/Seneschal%20Marov%20Harkomir.md). He pays you all and informs you of a break in he'd like you to investigate.
